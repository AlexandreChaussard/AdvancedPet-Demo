How to install the pet ?
---------------------------------

A. Get the Mythicmobs ready

1. Take the folder "Packs" in "MythicMobs/Packs" and put it inside the MythicMobs folder, fusionning it with the previous "Packs" folder if it already exists.
2. Reload MythicMobs with /mm r

B. Get the models ready

1. Get the .bbmodel file that you just bought, and put them into ModelEngine's blueprint folder
2. Reload ModelEngine using /meg reload

C. Add the pet to AdvancedPet

Take the folder "AdvancedPet" and put it directly into your "plugins" folder. The file will merge and add the otter to the pack.

Then get in game and make sure to reload the plugin with /advancedpet reload

D. Testing

Open the pet GUI with /advancedpet.
The otter should show up in the available pets if you have the advancedpet.otter permission.
Spawns the mob and try to interact with it with right click to test the petting animations.
Then despawn the pet from the pet GUI and check out the despawn animation.
